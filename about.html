    <div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 text-gray-300 prose prose-invert">
      <p>I’m Clay Warren, the developer and founder behind Adinkra Studio—a one-man engine turning ideas into software solutions at $500–$1,000+ a pop. Based on a belief that great tech shouldn’t cost a fortune, I’ve built a studio that delivers websites, iOS apps, video games, and desktop apps with speed, precision, and a touch of creativity—all powered by AI to keep costs low and quality high.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#d4af37] mt-6">My Story</h2>
      <p>I grew up in Iowa, and stumbled into software development through a mix of curiosity and grit. It is a craft that blends problem-solving with a passion for building things that matter. Adinkra Studio was born from that journey—a nod to the Adinkra symbols-In supergravity & supersymmetric representation theory, Adinkra symbols are a 
graphical representation of supersymmetric algebras. Mathematically they can be described as colored finite connected simple graphs, that are bipartite & n-regular. Where art and meaning collide, and a mission to make software accessible without the bloated price tags.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#d4af37] mt-6">Why Adinkra Studio?</h2>
      <p>The big dev shops charge thousands for what I can do faster and smarter. At Adinkra Studio, I use AI tools—like code generation and optimization—to slash timelines from months to days, delivering $500 websites that convert, $500 iOS apps that shine, and $1,000 games or desktop apps that pack a punch. My process is simple: we define your goal, I build it with clean code (HTML, Swift, C++, you name it), and you get a product that works—50% deposit up front, 50% on delivery. No fluff, no BS, just results.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#d4af37] mt-6">What Drives Me</h2>
      <p>I’m in this because I love the grind—turning a blank screen into something real, whether it’s a nonprofit’s site spiking traffic 300% or an iOS app hitting 15,000 downloads in a month. Every project’s a chance to solve a problem, tell a story, and push what’s possible. Adinkra Studio isn’t just about code—it’s about impact, from startups to indie devs to businesses needing a digital edge.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#d4af37] mt-6">How I Work</h2>
      <p>Collaboration’s key—I start with your vision, sketch it out, and build with tools like Xcode, Unreal Engine, or straight HTML/CSS/JS. AI speeds up the heavy lifting, but my hands are on every detail—testing, tweaking, launching. You get a product that’s yours, fast, for $500–$1k+.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#d4af37] mt-6">What’s Next</h2>
      <p>In 2025, I’m pushing Adinkra Studio further—more AI, tighter builds, and bigger dreams. Your project’s next—whether it’s a website, app, or game, I’m here to make it real, affordable, and great. Let’s talk about what you need and how we can build it together.</p>
